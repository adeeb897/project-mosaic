# Project Mosaic - Quick Start Guide

Get your autonomous agent platform running in **5 minutes**!

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Redis (or Docker to run it)
- OpenAI API key

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Get the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/project-mosaic.git
cd project-mosaic
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
```

Your `.env` should look like:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### 4. Start Redis

**Option A: Using Docker** (recommended)
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name mosaic-redis redis:latest
```

**Option B: Local Redis** (if installed)
```bash
redis-server
```

### 5. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Project Mosaic Server is ready!

üìä Services:
   - REST API: http://localhost:3000/api
   - WebSocket: ws://localhost:3000
   - Health Check: http://localhost:3000/health

üéØ Ready to create autonomous agents!
```

### 6. Start the Frontend

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.0.4
- Local:        http://localhost:3001
```

### 7. Open the Dashboard

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:3001**

You should see the Project Mosaic Admin Dashboard!

## Create Your First Agent

### 1. Click "Create Agent"

In the Agents tab, click the blue "Create Agent" button.

### 2. Fill in the Form

- **Agent Name**: `ResearchAgent`
- **High-Level Task**: `Research renewable energy solutions and create a comprehensive report`

### 3. Create and Start

1. Click **"Create"**
2. You'll see the agent appear in the list with status "idle"
3. Click the **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play** button to start the agent

### 4. Watch It Work!

Switch to the **"Activity"** tab to see real-time updates:

```
üéØ [10:30:15] Started working on: Research renewable energy...
   Task: Research renewable energy solutions

üõ†Ô∏è [10:30:18] Used filesystem.write_file: Creating research plan
   Status: completed

üåê [10:30:25] Navigated to: wikipedia.org/Renewable_energy
   Status: completed

‚úÖ [10:31:02] Completed: Gather background information
   Task: Research current technologies
```

### 5. View the Task Tree

Switch to the **"Task Tree"** tab to see how the agent broke down your high-level task:

```
‚úÖ Research renewable energy solutions [completed]
   Strategy: Break into research, analysis, and writing phases
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚è≥ Research current technologies [in_progress]
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Search for solar energy information [completed]
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Search for wind energy information [completed]
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚è∏Ô∏è  Search for hydroelectric information [pending]
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚è∏Ô∏è  Analyze market trends and statistics [pending]
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚è∏Ô∏è  Find adoption rates [pending]
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚è∏Ô∏è  Gather cost comparison data [pending]
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚è∏Ô∏è  Write comprehensive report [pending]
```

## Example Tasks to Try

### Simple Tasks (Good for Testing)
```
Create a file called "hello.txt" with a greeting message
```

### Medium Complexity
```
Research the top 5 climate change solutions and summarize them in a document
```

### High Complexity
```
Create a comprehensive business plan for a renewable energy startup, including market research, competitive analysis, and financial projections
```

### Very Ambitious
```
Research current AI safety approaches, identify gaps, and propose new research directions
```

The agent will automatically:
- Decide if the task should be decomposed
- Break it into manageable sub-tasks
- Execute each step
- Self-correct if errors occur
- Report progress in plain English

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to backend"

**Check if backend is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

**If not running:**
- Check terminal for errors
- Ensure port 3000 is not in use
- Verify `.env` has correct settings

### "WebSocket disconnected"

**Check Redis:**
```bash
docker ps | grep redis
```

**If not running:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name mosaic-redis redis:latest
```

### "OpenAI API error"

**Verify API key:**
- Check `.env` has `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...`
- Ensure key is valid and has credits
- Check usage: https://platform.openai.com/usage

### Port Already in Use

**If port 3000 is taken:**
Edit `backend/.env`:
```bash
PORT=3001
```

**If port 3001 is taken:**
Edit `frontend/package.json`:
```json
"dev": "next dev -p 3002"
```
